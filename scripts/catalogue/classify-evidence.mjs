// Step 3: turn sources into evidence records, at the strength each deserves.
//
// For every place this produces zero or more pieces of evidence:
//
//   Restaurant's own website   what it says, quoted, with the page it said it on
//   OpenStreetMap diet:halal   a community tag
//   Overture halal category    a third-party dataset's categorisation
//   Business name              the business calling itself halal
//
// Rules (deliberately conservative; the database turns evidence into labels):
//   - Only the restaurant's own clear words that ALL its meat is halal, with
//     nothing on its pages contradicting that (pork, non-cured-turkey bacon,
//     prosciutto, "non-halal"), become strong evidence of fully halal. Every
//     one of those is listed in review-strong.tsv for a person to confirm
//     before import; anything not confirmed is imported at moderate strength.
//   - A restaurant saying it is HMC or HFA certified is recorded as a claim of
//     certification, not as certification. It is not confirmed with the
//     certifier, so it is moderate, which cannot produce Fully Halal.
//   - "Halal options", or halal food alongside pork or non-halal wording, is
//     moderate evidence of Halal Options.
//   - A chain website saying halal is only served at some branches, without
//     saying which, records nothing for any branch: neither a listing nor a
//     claim that a branch is not halal.
//   - Names, tags and categories are weak whatever they claim: at most
//     Unverified.
//   - A branch with no website of its own takes its chain's statement, for the
//     short list of chains whose central sites were read (CHAINS below), and
//     never above moderate.
//   - Text a site builder or ordering platform repeats across the sites it
//     hosts is not any restaurant speaking, and hosts listed in
//     screened-out.json were read and found not to be the listed place.
//
// Output: .cache/evidence.jsonl (one line per place with evidence) and review
