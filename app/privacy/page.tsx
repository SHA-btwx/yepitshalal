/**
 * Written from what the code actually does, not from a template. Every row of
 * the table below maps to a real route or table, so when one of them changes
 * this page has to change with it. The ones to watch:
 *
 *   /api/subscribe            subscribers
 *   /api/feedback             site_feedback
 *   /api/language-requests    language_requests
 *   /api/restaurants/submit   restaurant_submissions
 *   /api/founders             founder_applications
 *   /api/verification-requests
 *   Supabase Auth             magic link, email only
 *
 * Still to add once ICO registration is done: the registered entity name,
 * trading address and registration number. That registration produces exactly
 * those details, which is why they are not guessed at here.
 *
 * The PostHog row, the PostHog paragraph under Cookies and the Recordings
 * section describe lib/analytics/: the PostHog config, and the scrubber every
 * event and every recording passes through. If either changes, so do they.
 * "How fast pages load" is the web vitals setting there, "where people tap
 * and how far they scroll" is heatmaps, and recording starts only after a yes
 * in components/RecordingConsent.tsx. "It does not keep your IP address"
 * rests on cookieless server hash mode, which strips the IP before anything
 * is stored, so that switch in PostHog has to stay on. "30 days" is the free
 * plan's limit for keeping recordings. "Where you are" under Recordings, and
 * "never gets your exact location" under Cookies, rest on MASK_CLASS around
 * the searched place and every distance from it, UNRECORDED_CLASS on the
 * map, and autocapture leaving out each map pin's style.

          Hashing an IP address, to stop the forms being flooded. Counting visits and
          button taps, so we know which pages are worth keeping. Seeing where people tap
          and how far they scroll, added up across everyone, so we know what to fix.
          Timing how fast pages load, so we can make slow ones faster. Hearing when a page
          breaks, so we can fix it. Each is the gentlest way we could think of to do it.

      <h2 className={`mt-12 ${sectionTitle}`}>Cookies</h2>
      <p className="mt-2 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted">
        We do not use advertising or tracking cookies. Our visitor analytics, from
        Vercel, does not use cookies and does not follow you between sites. If you sign
        in, Supabase sets a cookie that keeps you signed in, because you asked to be
        signed in.

      <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted">
        PostHog counts which pages and buttons get used, and sees where people tap and
        how far they scroll. It times how fast each page loads, and it tells us when a
        page breaks. For all of that it sets no cookies and stores nothing on your
        device. To tell one visit from another, it makes a code from your IP address and
        your browser. The code changes every day. Nobody can turn it back into your IP
        address or your browser, and PostHog does not keep your IP address. It never
        gets your exact location, your full postcode, or your email address.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted">
        The one thing we ask about is recording your visit, below. Whatever you answer,
        your browser remembers it, so we do not ask again.

        We ask before we record a visit. A recording shows where someone clicked, tapped
        and scrolled, and what the pages looked like. We watch them to find what is hard
        to use, so we can fix it.

        <li>Pages with your own details, like your account, show as an empty box.</li>
        <li>

          visit join up. It goes when you close the tab, or as soon as you say no.

        <li>PostHog keeps each recording for 30 days, then deletes it.</li>
