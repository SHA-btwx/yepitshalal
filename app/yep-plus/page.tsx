// The case for support, as a short story told in cards (2026-09-24), and then
// the ask. Nothing on this page may promise something that does not exist.
// Every perk listed is already built: the meal pledge (worded as us donating,
// see the vault's "Charitable claims must not outrun the mechanism"), the
// monthly area vote, the supporter badge, first look at new things, and no
// sponsored messages. The earlier "supporting now counts for more" section
// promised offers that do not exist yet, so it is gone.
//
// Prices print from SUPPORTER_PRICES, the same values the checkout's price
// guard compares against Stripe. The buttons are only live when Stripe
// actually holds those prices (lib/supporterReadiness): until then the page
// says so instead of offering a checkout that can only refuse.
