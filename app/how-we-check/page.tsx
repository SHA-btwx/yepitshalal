              Mosques and prayer spaces come from OpenStreetMap, the same open source as much of the

              says nothing about that restaurant&apos;s food. Hardly any of them carry opening times, a
              mosque listed as open may still be locked, and the doors being open is not the same as

              Standards differ. Some people only eat hand-slaughtered meat, some avoid places that
              serve alcohol, and restaurants change suppliers. A label is a starting point built from
              the evidence we can see. The kitchen is the only one who can tell you for certain, so
              ask them.
