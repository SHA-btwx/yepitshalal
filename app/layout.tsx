// Newsreader and IBM Plex Sans, replacing Fraunces and Inter on 2026-09-22.
//
// Inter was the one that had to go. It is the default of nearly every site
// built quickly in the last three years, to the point that it reads as a
// signal about how a site was made rather than about what it is for, and this
// site's whole argument is that somebody actually did the work.
//
// IBM Plex Sans is the deliberate answer to that: humanist, a little tighter
// than Inter, with letterforms that have an opinion, and a register that reads
// institutional rather than launched. It is a typeface commissioned to sit on
// documentation, which is what most of this site is.
//
// Newsreader replaces Fraunces for the same reason in the other direction.
// Fraunces is a lovely, slightly boutique display serif, and boutique is the
// wrong note for a site whose pitch is "here is the evidence and the date it
// was read". Newsreader was drawn for long-form reading, carries an optical
// size axis, and puts the headings in the same register as a newspaper
// standfirst. That is the voice the copy has always had.

  // Declared by hand, as static files, for two reasons Google cares about.
  //
  // Next's generated icon routes hang a content hash off the URL
  // (/icon?c22bee58af459c4e), so the favicon's address changed with every
  // deploy that touched it, and a crawler that caches favicons by URL was
  // never looking at the same one twice. These paths never change.
  //
  // And the sizes here are the sizes of the files. The generated favicon.ico
  // was declared 32x32, which is below the 48px Google will use, so the one
  // icon sitting at the root of the domain was advertising itself as too small
  // to show.
  //
  // Moved once, on 2026-09-24, to new addresses: Google Search was still
  // showing the old green pin with a tick hours after the new logo went live,
  // and a fresh address cannot be answered from its cache. Every size is the
  // halal pin with حلال on the teal disc (48px and up is what Google shows); the
  // Arabic-free "C" of the first set is gone. Keep these addresses from now on.
