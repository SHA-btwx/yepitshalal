/**
 * This page exists for two reasons that point the same way.
 *
 * The product reason: a directory that publishes what it does not know has to
 * make it easy to be told it is wrong, or the honesty is decoration.
 *
 * The legal reason: publishing something false about a named business that
 * costs it custom is defamation or malicious falsehood. A published, promptly
 * honoured correction route is the cheapest protection available, and the
 * absence of one is what turns a mistake into a claim. Do not remove it, and
 * do not let the response times here become untrue.
 *
 * Corrections are support work, so the address is help@ (lib/site INBOX).
