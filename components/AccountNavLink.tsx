// Vercel from keeping a copy of any page, even the ones set to be kept for an
// hour. Now the header is the same for everybody and this link looks for the
// session cookie in the browser.

// It only picks a label, so the cookie being there is enough: if the session
// has expired, /account sends the visitor to sign in, as it always has. Every
