// The YepItsHalal logo, chosen by Shabir on 2026-09-24 from five variations:
// "YEP ITS" set straight, YEP in white and ITS in lime, over a lime location
// pin that holds حلال in white, on a deep teal disc inside a white ring. It
// reads as one sentence, "Yep, it's halal", with the Arabic word as the pin.
//
// The files in /public/brand are traced from that artwork, not redrawn, so the
// lettering and the calligraphy are exactly as designed; only the ring was
// replaced by a true circle. Built by ~/.claude/tools/brand/trace-logo.mjs and
// build-logo.mjs.
//
// Three forms of it, each used where it can be read:
//
//  - LogoMark: the pin and حلال on the teal disc, no English, for 32 to 64px
//    (the header). The favicons (public/favicon*) are the same pin and word,
//    larger on the disc and without the white ring, at every size: the
//    Arabic-free pin reads as a "C" (2026-09-24).
//  - LogoLockup: the mark beside YEP ITS HALAL, for navigation. The logo
//    writes halal in Arabic; the lockup spells it out so the name reads.
//  - LogoBadge: the whole logo, from about 96px up (the footer, the support
//    card, social profiles, app icons).
//
// Still no tick, and no seal wording round the edge: a round حلال badge with
// either would read as a halal certification, and YepItsHalal certifies
// nothing (see /terms).
