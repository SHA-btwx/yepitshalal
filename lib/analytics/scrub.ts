// the analytics does not follow anyone around. The mobile app plan in the
// vault sets the same line for the app: no coordinates, no full postcodes, no
// email addresses, no report text. Recordings of visitors who said yes are
// held to the same line by the mask functions at the end of this file.

// Pages that show someone's own details: the admin queue lists submitters'
// email addresses, /account shows yours, /manage is a restaurant owner's own
// dashboard. No event that happens on them is sent at all, and recordings
// show them as an empty box (BLOCK_CLASS, below).

//   walking time measured from it, because three of those pin down the spot;

//   size;
