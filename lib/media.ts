// Every picture made for the site, in one place, so the homepage, Discover,
// Add a restaurant and Support show the same street, the same room and the
// same loop rather than three versions of each. All were generated for
// YepItsHalal (see /image-credits): none shows a real restaurant, mosque or
// person, and none is ever used as a photo of a listed place.
//
// Widths are the files that exist in /public/media. A phone gets the tall
// composition where there is one: the street was recomposed vertically, with
// calm sky at the top and dark pavement at the bottom, so words can sit on it.
//
// The loops are the generated originals, untouched: 1276x720 (the tall street
// 720x1276), five seconds, 4.5 to 13 Mbps (2026-09-24). The first versions
// were re-recorded through a canvas at about 1.5 Mbps and cut to three
// seconds, and Shabir saw it at once: "horrific, rendered down". Phones get
// the same files, not smaller copies. The seam where a clip starts again is
// hidden by a crossfade in the page (SceneMedia), not baked into the file.
