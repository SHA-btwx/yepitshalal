-- Enforce the retention periods published on /privacy.
--
-- /privacy promises that IP hashes are kept for 12 months and that what people
-- write to us is kept for two years. A published retention period that nothing
-- enforces is a false statement about personal data, which is exactly what the
-- page exists to avoid. This makes both numbers true.
--
-- Written 2026-09-21, applied the same day. Every table below had 0 rows when
-- it was written, so the first run that deletes anything is roughly
-- September 2027.
--
-- Why most rules clear columns instead of deleting rows:
--
--   site_feedback           Deleted after two years. Every field is personal.
--
--   language_requests       Email removed after two years, the vote kept. How
--                           many people asked for a language is not personal,
--                           and it is the whole reason the table exists.
--
--   restaurant_submissions  Contact name, email and notes removed after two
--                           years. The business details and the halal evidence
--                           stay: they are not personal data, and they are the
--                           record of why a place was listed, which is what
--                           answers a dispute about a label. Deleting them
--                           would throw away the defence the corrections page
--                           relies on.
--
--   ip_hash, everywhere     Cleared after 12 months.
--
-- verification_requests keeps its rows. It is a paid service, and payment
-- records are kept as long as tax rules require. Only its hash expires.
